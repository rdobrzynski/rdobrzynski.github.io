```{r, message==FALSE}
#pred <- predict(forest_ranger, test)
#cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = as.factor(test$target), positive = "high")
#cm$overall[1]
 #Accuracy 
#0.823 
```

The best model appears to be the Random Forest. This model was used to predict the target variable in the test data set. The accuracy of the model was .82. 
---
A new Target variable was made that classifies whether a patient's stay was short or long based on the average length of stay. 
```{r}
#mean_los <- mean(df$los)
#ds$Targ<- ifelse(df$los<5,"short","long")
#ds$Targ <- factor(ds$Targ)
```

The best model appears to be the Random Forest. This model was used to predict the target variable in the test data set. The accuracy of the model was .84.
```{r}
#cm1 <- confusionMatrix(data = pred1, reference = test1$Targ, positive = "short")

#cm1$overall[1]

![error](C:/Users\student\Desktop\Math421\Math421\error.png)

Error: Lengths must be equal in confusion matrix.
Fix: Looked up the length for pred1 and test1, took a random sample from test1 to match the length of pred1
